# Social Game Tycoon

A game created with AngularJS and Firebase, you play as a social game studio trying to make a successful game. 

Social gaming has risen in popularity and become a billion dollar industry, yet is the focus of few studies. This project focuses on exploring current thoughts and understanding of social games, particularly the thoughts of Dr Ian Bogost who explored concerning concepts of social gaming in an article ([link](http://www.bogost.com/blog/cow_clicker_1.shtml)). Notably he mentioned the term optionalism, describing gameplay as being very rote and empty.

Exploring optionalism further, links were made to time and failure as components of social games which facilitates optionalism. Moving from the theoretical understanding to that of practical implementations, a social game was developed involving these concepts along with an integrated survey to gauge the opinions of audiences.

This game was part of a University of Lincoln Dissertation: Understanding Optionalism in Social Games. 

Also part of a submission to GameOn conference 2014: [How Social Gaming uses Optionalism as an Illusion for Gameplay](https://github.com/arne3000/social-game-tycoon/blob/master/Ubelhor%20GameOn%202014%20paper%20submission.pdf).
